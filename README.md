## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Built with Node.js and Express.js as the backend, connected to MongoDB for the database, EJS for the templating language with styling by Tailwind CSS, specifically using DaisyUI components. This was put together with the budget of the client in mind, so utilizing pre-existing frameworks and component libraries was key to a successful deployment.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggests lessons from this were the specific aggregation pipeline features in MongoDB. Utilizing match and sample to build bigger quieries with randomization built in was an interesting challenge.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
